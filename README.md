Application is not yet production ready. ideally would need to be scaled. Server side rendering would be more effecient


Where https://www.metrotransit.org/nextrip uses a drop down menu for routes, directions and stops, this mock uses a drop down menu for just routes and directions. 
because it does not render any more information, it seemed more user friendly to not require scrolling through stop options since it will be read only. This app is in the process of being refactored for cleaner code.
